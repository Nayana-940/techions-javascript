//If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
let x = "5" + 2 + 3;
console.log("value of x=",x)
let y= 2 + 6 +"1"
console.log("value of y=",y)
//When to Use var, let, or const?
//1. Always declare variables

//2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

//3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

//4. Only use let if you can't use const

//5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.



//JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

const pi = 3.14;
console.log("value of pi=",pi)


let person = "John Doe";
console.log("Name of  a person=",person)

let answer = 'Yes I am!';
console.log(answer)
