//A variable defined with the const keyword cannot be reassigned:

const PI = 3.141592653589793;//JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:


///PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error


//Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

//Use const when you declare:

//A new Array,A new Object,A new Function,A new RegExp

// ARRAY CREATION

const Cars=["Volvo","Toyota","Ferrari"]
console.log("car names are",Cars)

//Constant object
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
